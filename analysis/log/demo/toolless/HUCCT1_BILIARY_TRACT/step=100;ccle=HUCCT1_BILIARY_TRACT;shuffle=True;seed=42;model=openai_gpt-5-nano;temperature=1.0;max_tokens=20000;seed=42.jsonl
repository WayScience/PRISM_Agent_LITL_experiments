If the IC50 lies around 2–3 μM, it would correspond to the second dilution point (2.5 μM) in this scheme. Therefore, a plausible single-point estimate is in the vicinity of 2.5–3 μM; I selected 2.8 μM as a representative estimate. The stated confidence is moderate because the prediction relies on general potency trends and cross-line data rather than a line-specific dataset. Actual IC50 could differ due to factors such as assay time, Hill coefficient, compound solubility, and cell-line specific sensitivity. This value should be validated with full dose–response data from the specific assay conditions described.", "trajecory": null, "ic50_true": 0.108436401678322, "metrics": null}
